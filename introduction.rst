Hello.

These are notes for a 3 hour course (6 x 25 minute sessions) for experienced Parsl users who want to level-up their ability to use Parsl or to hack on the Parsl codebase by learning more about how Parsl works inside.

This text is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all parts of the Parsl codebase, but it should get you started on further exploration.

You might like to have a throw-away installation of Parsl 2024.09.02 that you can work with as you go through these notes.
