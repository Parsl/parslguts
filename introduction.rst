Introduction

Hello.

These are notes for a 3 hour course (6 x 25 minute sessions) for experienced Parsl users who want to level-up their ability to use Parsl or to hack on the Parsl codebase by learning more about how Parsl works inside. This is a contrast to the user guide, which focuses on what Parsl looks like from the outside.

This text is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all parts of the Parsl codebase: there is plenty more to learn about.

I'll try to include links to relevant external resources: other Parsl documentation, community talks, and papers and other research work.
