modularity and plugins
######################

which bits you can swap for other plugins: how and why

why includes sustainability work on different quality of code/maintenance

if there's a decision point that looks like a multi-way if statement - having a bunch of choices is a suggestion that choices you might not have implemented might also exist, and someone might want to put those in. various plugin points then look like "expandable if" statements. a good contrast is the launcher plugin interface, vs the hard-coded MPI plugin interface (cross reference issue to fix that)
